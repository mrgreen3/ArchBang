====Installation====

To run installer select Install in main menu.

The installer is menu driven and very easy to follow. 

Should you need an easier way to set up partitions and filesystems then Gparted is included live. [sudo gparted in a terminal]

===Post Install===

Pacman will not work until you do the following in a terminal:

sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate
sudo pacman -Sy --needed archlinux-keyring && sudo pacman -Su

This will create keys, refresh package cache and update archlinux-keyring.

Then you can search for a package of choice using:

sudo pacman -Ss

Install a pacakge using

sudo pacman -S


For more help, guides search the Arch Wiki [https://wiki.archlinux.org/]

====Tips and tricks?====

If your drive space fills up live then run the following to double size of storage.

sudo mount -o remount,size=8G /run/archiso/cowspace

By default pacman mirrorlist is un-commented to allow it to work live, read Arch wiki guide on mirrors and setting them up here:
